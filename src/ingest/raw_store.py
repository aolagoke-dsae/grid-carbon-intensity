"""Write-once raw storage, shared by every ingestion client.

raw/ is append-only. A logical item -- one ENTSO-E document type, zone and
year; one SMARD index or week -- is a DIRECTORY, and every retrieval of it is
a new file inside, named <UTC time>_<first 8 hex digits of its sha256>:

    raw/A44/10Y1001A1001A82H/2025/20261006T183150Z_9d48b590.xml
    raw/A44/10Y1001A1001A82H/2025/_failed/20261010T091500Z_3f2a1c0d.xml

Nothing is ever overwritten. A response that is not data goes to _failed/,
kept for diagnosis and never read as the current version. Downstream takes the
newest accepted file in the directory (current_version).

Why it exists: until 10.10.2026 each client wrote straight onto <year>.xml.
The first A44 pull of 06.10 was overwritten by the second, so the payload
behind the first manifest row no longer exists, and an expired token's 401
page would have replaced a year of data while smoke.py printed ACCEPTED.
